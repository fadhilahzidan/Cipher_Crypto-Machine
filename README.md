# Cypher_Crypto-Machine
Cypher Crypto-Machine is a simple Python-based encryption and decryption tool that allows you to encode and decode text using various cypher techniques.

## Features
1. Caesar Cipher
2. Substitution Cipher
3. Vigenère Cipher

## Usage
1. Choose a cipher technique from the menu.
2. Input the text you want to encrypt or decrypt.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to provide additional information (e.g., key, shift value).
4. The encrypted or decrypted text will be displayed.

## Examples uses
1. Caesar Cipher
- Cipher Technique: Caesar Cipher
- Enter text: Hello, World!
- Enter shift value: 3
>> Encrypted: Khoor, Zruog!

2. Using Substitution Cipher
- Cipher Technique: Substitution Cipher
- Enter text: Hello, World!
- Enter substitution key: qazwsxedcrfvtgbyhnujmikolp
>> Encrypted: Ittgi, Yvnig!

### Vigenère Cipher
- Cipher Technique: Vigenère Cipher
- Enter text: Hello, World!
- Enter keyword: KEY
>> Encrypted: Rioga, Utmij!
